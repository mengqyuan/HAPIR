HAPIR: a refined Hallmark gene set-based machine learning approach for predicting immunotherapy response in cancer patients

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, yet the response rate remains limited, with only about 30% of solid tumor patients benefiting. Identifying reliable biomarkers to predict ICIs response remains a significant challenge. In this study, we proposed a refined Hallmark gene set-based Approach for Predicting Immunotherapy Response (HAPIR).
